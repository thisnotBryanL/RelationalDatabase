# RelationalDatabase

The Department of Journalism, Public Relations and New Media would like to build a database system to keep track of Qualtrics data that is collected each semester about student progress in the Advanced Public Relations course.

This Database will keep track of:

-Supervisor Information
-Evaluation information (reviews from both student and supervisor)
-Portfolio Review

Current To-Do list:
-Figure out all the ways the user can input information
-Design Schema
