# RelationalDatabase

The Department of Journalism, Public Relations and New Media would like to build a database system to keep track of Qualtrics data that is collected each semester about student progress in the Advanced Public Relations course.

## This Database will keep track of:

- Student Portfolio (and Personal information)

- Internship Information

- Supervisor Information

- Evaluation information (reviews from both student and supervisor)

- Portfolio Review

## Current To-Do list:

- Connect all datbase queries

- Make GUI windows for inserting answers with questions

- Implement all search GUI windows/tables

- CSV parser for Qualtrics
